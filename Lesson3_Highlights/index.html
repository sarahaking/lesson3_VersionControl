            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records the changes made to a file or multiple files so that one can recall specific versions later. This is beneficial because it allows one to revert the current project back to a previous state. It can also allow one to compare the changes that have been made to the project. Local version control systems have a simple database to keep track of this. Centralized version control systems allow collaboration with other developers between computers. Distributed version control systems fully mirror the repository, so if one server dies, there is a full backup.</p></p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a system that stores information and data. Git started off in 2005 with the goals of increasing speed, having a simple design, and being able to handle large loads of data. Git is also different than most systems. Many systems store information as a list of file-based changes. Git, however, takes a picture of what the files look like at that moments and saves a reference of that screenshot for you to come back to later. So for Git, data is store more like a stream of snapshots. Also, Git tends to operate mostly through local systems. Because of this, most operations seem instantaneous. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two main ways to create a project with Git. One way uses and existing project or directory and imports that project into Git. The second way simply clones an already existing Git repository from another server. If you want a copy of an existing Git repository, you must use the git clone command. This command automatically pulls down every copy, so that Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. This is beneficial as if the server is corrupted, it is easy to get the server back to the state it was in.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In one’s working directory, there are two types of files, tracked and untracked. Tracked files are all of the files that were in the last screenshot. These files can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are all other files that are not in your staging area. Git also has a command to see which files are in which state. This command is “git status and will tell you if any of your tracked files are modified, or if you have any untracked files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many different ways to change files. In order to remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your staging area and then commit. This can be done through use of the “git rm” command, which also removes the file from your working directory. Git also has a way where you can view exactly what you’ve changed. It can tell you what you’ve changed but not yet staged, and what you’ve staged that you are about to commit. The command “git diff” shows you the exact lines that were added and removed.</p>
